# NN_2layers_implementation_mnist

This repository contains a simple 2-layer neural network implemented from scratch in Python to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. No high-level deep learning libraries were used.

## Features
- Implemented forward and backward propagation manually
- Uses sigmoid activation function
- Trains on MNIST dataset

## Files
- main.py → main Python script for training and testing
- mnist.npz → dataset (not included in repo; please download separately)

## Usage
1. Download the MNIST dataset.
2. Run main.py in Python 3.x:
   `bash
   python main.py
